Required for many science and engineering majors, exceeds premedical requirement. The study of physical phenomena in the fields of mechanics, heat, and waves. Concurrent enrollment in MATH 1426 (per prerequisite) is not recommended if no prior background in calculus.</span></p>

<p><strong>Archival Review:</strong></p>

<p>Greene offered to tutor us through any material we didn&#39;t cover in the first section: &lt;michaelagreene@mavs.uta.edu&gt;</p>

<p>The class was rather difficult since it was my first exposure to calculus based physics. Taking the derivitives of position functions seemed to be the only actual calculus that was expected of us. Most of the forumulas could be pre-derived, but I suspect I would&#39;ve been better served going to class more regularly. I did poorly on the tests, but score perfect marks on the labwork and homework. In the future, see if the TA or instructor will cover the test and talk about better ways to approach the questions.&nbsp;</p>
