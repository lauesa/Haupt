Class primarily centered around the reading and the lecture is used to briefly point out certain elements in the reading. \r\n\r\n#### Notes:\r\n\r\nMany of the explanations in class are overdeveloped for this course. New teacher may be relying on advanced knowledge to explain unfamiliar concepts. Recommended Study: Reading Notes and Slide Reviews\r\n\r\n### PHYS 1443-006 LAB Mo 12:00PM - 2:50PM SH  114\r\n\r\nInitial class will be Sept. 14. \r\n\r\n#### Notes:\r\n\r\nLab manual will be required.\r\n\r\n### PHYS 1443-003 Technical Physics I Lecture TuThu 11:00AM-12:20PM\r\n\r\nGeneral Physics course that is primarily lecture through slides. Attendance not required, but recommended. Only basic calculus knowledge required.\r\n\r\n#### Special Links:\r\n\r\n[Slides and Syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b0e6elasdfaayx2/AADO-4W2RaVMYueHctr3XYQ-a?dl=0) \r\n\r\n#### Notes:\r\n\r\nHomework and quizzes will be used in Mastering Physics. Need to purchase that.\r\n\r\n### CSE 1320-003 TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM SH  125\r\n\r\nIntroduction to C.\r\n\r\n#### Special Links:\r\n\r\n[Slides and Syllabus](https://sites.google.com/site/gustavopuertosouza/home/cse-1320)\r\n\r\n#### Notes:\r\n\r\nBook will be largely useless for the class. Look for a book that encompasses both C and C++. Bring Computer to class for in-class homework.\r\n\r\n### CSE 2315-003 TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM NH  203\r\n\r\nDiscrete Structures. Mathematical representation of logic.\r\n\r\n#### Notes: \r\n\r\nThis is an incredibly exact and demanding. Make sure to read the text and do the homework. Since I have a different book, Gao has placed the book on reserve in the SEL.
